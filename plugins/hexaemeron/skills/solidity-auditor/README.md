# Solidity Auditor

A security agent with a simple mission - findings in minutes, not weeks.

Built for:

- **Solidity devs** who want a security check before every commit
- **Security researchers** looking for fast wins before a manual review
- **Just about anyone** who wants an extra pair of eyes.

Not a substitute for a formal audit - but the check you should never skip.

## Usage

```
Use the bundled `hexaemeron:solidity-auditor` skill to audit this codebase.
```

```
run solidity auditor on *specified files*
```

## Tips

- **Target hot contracts.** Rather than scanning an entire repo, point the tool at the 2-5 contracts you're actively changing. Smaller scope means denser context for each agent and higher-signal findings.
- **Run more than once.** LLM output is non-deterministic — each run can surface different vulnerabilities. Two or three passes over the same code often catch things a single pass misses.
